# 🚀 Quick Start - Claude Code CLI

## ✅ Installation Complete!

**Claude Code CLI v2.0.76** is now installed on your system.

---

## Where It's Used

### ⚠️ Important: Different from This Chat!

- **This Chat (Cursor)**: Uses Cursor's built-in AI (me, Auto) - **No account needed**
- **Claude Code CLI**: Separate tool for **TERMINAL use** - **Requires Anthropic account**

**They work independently!** You can use both.

## Next Steps (Terminal)

### 1. Authenticate (First Time Only)

Open a **new terminal** (PowerShell or Command Prompt) and run:

```bash
claude auth login
```

**You'll need:**
- Anthropic account (Pro or Max plan - $20+/month)
- Visit https://claude.ai to sign up if needed
- Follow the authentication prompts

### 2. Test It Works

```bash
claude --version

```

### 3. Try It Out

```bash
# Ask a question
claude "What is this project about?"
