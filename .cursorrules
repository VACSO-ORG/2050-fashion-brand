# by 2050 - Cursor AI Rules

## Project Context
High-end sustainable men's fashion brand built on Shopify. Target audience: high-net-worth individuals aged 25-35.

## Critical Design Rules

### Hero Section
- MUST start at absolute top (no white space above)
- MUST be exactly 100vh height (height: 100vh, min-height: 100vh, max-height: 100vh)
- ALL text MUST be visible and centered on page load
- Use flexbox for perfect vertical/horizontal centering
- Use logical spacing (gap, not excessive padding)
- Use clamp() for responsive typography

### Colors
- NO blue colors anywhere
- Use greens (#2d5016, #4a7c59) for sustainability
- Use greys (#1a1a1a, #2c2c2c) for text/backgrounds
- Use earth tones (#8b6f47) for accents
- Force color consistency with !important if needed

### Header
- Hidden on hero section (opacity: 0, visibility: hidden, transform: translateY(-100%))
- Only appears after scrolling 500px past hero
- No white banner visible on homepage

### Sections
- Hide empty sections (check for content before rendering)
- Product tiles: reasonable size (1.4rem title, 1.5rem price)
- Use consistent spacing scale (CSS variables)

## Code Standards
- Shopify Liquid: Use {% render %} for snippets, {% schema %} for settings
- CSS: BEM naming, CSS variables, mobile-first
- JavaScript: ES6+ (classes, async/await)
- HTML: Semantic HTML5, proper heading hierarchy (h1 for hero)

## Spacing Logic
- Hero: Use flexbox gap (2rem), NOT excessive padding
- Sections: Use CSS variable spacing scale
- Products: Compact, readable sizes
- Viewport-based: Use vh/vw/clamp() for responsive sizing

## File Organization
- Standard Shopify structure (assets/, sections/, snippets/, templates/)
- Keep docs/ and scripts/ organized
- Use .cursorignore for performance

## Always Check
- ✅ All text visible on page load?
- ✅ Hero starts at top with no white space?
- ✅ Colors consistent (no blue)?
- ✅ Header hidden on hero?
- ✅ Proper spacing and centering?
- ✅ Responsive on all screen sizes?
