# 🎯 How to Get Your Store URL - Step by Step

## ✅ You're Already in the Right Place!

I can see you're in the Shopify Partners dashboard. Here's exactly where to go:

---

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP:

### **STEP 1: Click "Stores" in the Left Sidebar**

Look at the left navigation menu. You'll see:
- Home (currently selected - highlighted in green)
- **Stores** ← **CLICK THIS ONE**
- Sales
- App distribution
- Themes
- Shopify POS

**Click on "Stores"**

---

### **STEP 2: Create a Development Store**

After clicking "Stores", you'll see:

1. **Click the "Add store" button** (usually top right, green button)

2. **Select "Development store"** from the options

3. **Fill in the form:**
   - **Store name:** `2050-fashion-brand` (or your choice)
   - **Store purpose:** Development
   - **Store type:** Development store
   - **Do you want to transfer an existing store?** No

4. **Click "Create development store"**

---

### **STEP 3: Get Your Store URL**

After the store is created (takes 10-30 seconds):

1. **You'll see your store in the list** - click on the store name

2. **OR** you'll be taken directly to the store admin

3. **Look at the URL in your browser** - it will be:
   ```
   https://YOUR-STORE-NAME.myshopify.com/admin
   ```

4. **Your store URL is:** `YOUR-STORE-NAME.myshopify.com`

   **Example:** If it says `https://2050-fashion-brand.myshopify.com/admin`
   **Your store URL is:** `2050-fashion-brand.myshopify.com`

## 🎯 Quick Visual Guide:

```
Left Sidebar → Click "Stores" → Click "Add store" → 
Select "Development store" → Fill form → Create → 
Get URL from browser address bar
```

---

## ✅ What to Tell Me:

Once you have the URL, just say:

**"My store URL is: [store-name].myshopify.com"**

For example:
- "My store URL is: 2050-fashion-brand.myshopify.com"

Then I'll immediately connect your theme! 🚀

---

## 🆘 Alternative: From the "Get started" Section

I can also see in your dashboard there's a "Get started" section with:
- Task #3: "Create a development store" (not completed yet)

**You can also click on that task** to create a store directly from there!

---

## 🎉 You're Almost There!

Just:
1. Click **"Stores"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"Add store"**
3. Create the development store
4. Get the URL
5. Tell me the URL!

**It takes about 1 minute!** ⚡
