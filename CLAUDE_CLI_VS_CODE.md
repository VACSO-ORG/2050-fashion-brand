# Claude CLI vs Claude Code - Explained

## Quick Answer

**Claude CLI and Claude Code are related but different:**

- **Claude Code**: The overall product/service by Anthropic for AI-assisted coding
- **Claude CLI**: A command-line tool that's part of Claude Code (optional)
- **Claude Code in Cursor**: Built-in AI assistance in Cursor IDE (what you're using)

---

## Do You Need a Claude Code Account?

### ❌ NO - You Don't Need a Separate Account!

**You're already using Cursor**, which provides:
- ✅ Claude AI built-in (no separate account needed)
- ✅ Project context from `CLAUDE.md`
- ✅ Rules from `.cursor/rules/`
- ✅ MCP integration
- ✅ All Claude Code functionality

**Cursor uses its own AI system** - you don't need Anthropic's Claude Code subscription.

## When Would You Need Claude Code Account?

You'd only need a **separate Claude Code account** if you want to:
1. Use the standalone `claude` CLI command
2. Access `claude.ai/code` web interface
3. Use Claude Code outside of Cursor

**For your use case (Cursor IDE):** ❌ **Not needed!**
