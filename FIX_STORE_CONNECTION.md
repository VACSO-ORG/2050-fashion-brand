# 🔧 Fix Store Connection - Complete Solution

## ⚠️ The Issue:

Your store `thirsti-2.myshopify.com` is a **regular Shopify store** (paid account), not a **development store**. The CLI has restrictions with regular stores.

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: Two Options

### **Option 1: Create Development Store via Partners (BEST - RECOMMENDED)**

This is the **easiest and safest** way:

1. **Go to:** https://dev.shopify.com/dashboard/198448041/stores
2. **Click:** "Add store" (top right, green button)
3. **Select:** "Development store"
4. **Fill in:**
   - Store name: `2050-dev` or `2050-development`
   - Store purpose: Development
   - Store type: Development store
5. **Click:** "Create development store"
6. **Wait 10-30 seconds**
7. **Get the new store URL** (e.g., `2050-dev.myshopify.com`)

**Then tell me the new store URL and I'll connect immediately!**

**Why this is better:**
- ✅ FREE - No monthly fees
- ✅ CLI works perfectly with dev stores
- ✅ Safe testing environment
- ✅ Can break things without worry
- ✅ Perfect for theme development

### **Option 2: Use Your Current Store (More Complex)**

If you want to use `thirsti-2.myshopify.com`:

**The issue:** Regular stores need special setup for CLI access.

**Try this:**
1. **Make sure you're the store owner** (you are - I can see it)
2. **Go to:** Settings → Users and permissions
3. **Check your account** has full permissions
4. **Try logging out and back in** to the CLI

**OR** we can try connecting via the Partners account by transferring the store (more complex).

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED: Create Development Store

**Here's why:**
- Your current store (`thirsti-2.myshopify.com`) = Production store (for real customers)
- Development store = Testing store (for building themes)

**Best practice:**
- **Develop** on development store (FREE, safe)
- **Deploy** to production store when ready
