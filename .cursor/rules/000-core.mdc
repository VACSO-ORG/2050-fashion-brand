# Core Agent Rules - by 2050

## Always Apply

### Planning & Implementation
- Plan first, then implement
- Small diffs, minimal reformatting
- Run tests or typecheck after changes when available
- Ask before adding dependencies or changing configs
- Prefer existing patterns in this codebase
- Show commands to run, do not invent results

### Code Quality
- Follow Shopify Liquid best practices
- Use BEM naming for CSS classes
- Maintain semantic HTML5 structure
- Keep JavaScript ES6+ (classes, async/await)
- Use CSS variables for all colors

### Design Rules (Critical)
- Hero section: 100vh, all text visible on load, perfectly centered
- NO blue colors - only greens (#2d5016, #4a7c59), greys (#1a1a1a, #2c2c2c), earth tones (#8b6f47)
- Header hidden on hero, appears after 500px scroll
- Logical spacing using flexbox gap, not excessive padding
- Hide empty sections

### Safety
- Never overwrite existing files without checking
- Keep diffs minimal
- Test changes in localhost before deploying
- Verify Shopify theme check passes
