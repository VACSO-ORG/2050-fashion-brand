# Extensions Check - What You Actually Need

## ✅ What You Likely Already Have

If you've been working with Shopify/Liquid files, you probably already have:
- **Shopify Liquid** (by Shopify) - Most common one
- Or **Liquid** (by panoply) - Alternative

## 🔍 How to Check What You Have

1. **Open Extensions** (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
2. **Search for "liquid"** or "shopify"
3. **Check "Installed" tab** - see what you already have

## 📋 What's Actually Available

### Must Have (if not installed):
1. **Shopify Liquid** (by Shopify)
   - Publisher: Shopify
   - Extension ID: `shopify.liquid`
   - Search: "Shopify Liquid"

2. **Liquid** (by panoply) - Alternative
   - Publisher: panoply
   - Extension ID: `panoply.liquid`
   - Search: "Liquid"

### Optional (Nice to Have):
3. **Prettier** (by Prettier)
   - Code formatting
   - Search: "Prettier"

4. **Liquid Prettier** (by panoply) - May not exist
   - If you can't find this, it's okay - Prettier handles it

## ⚠️ Extensions That May Not Exist

Some extensions I mentioned might not be available:
- **Shopify Liquid Autocomplete** - May not be a separate extension
- **Liquid Prettier Plugin** - May be part of the main Liquid extension

## ✅ What You Actually Need

### Minimum Required:
- ✅ **One Liquid extension** (Shopify Liquid OR Liquid by panoply)
- ✅ That's it! You're good to go.

### Optional:
- Prettier (for code formatting)

## 🎯 Quick Check

1. Open Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
2. Search "liquid"
3. If you see ANY Liquid extension installed → ✅ You're good!
4. If not → Install "Shopify Liquid" (by Shopify)

## 💡 The Truth

**You probably already have everything you need!**

Most Liquid extensions include:
- Syntax highlighting ✅
- Autocomplete ✅
- Language support ✅

**You don't need multiple Liquid extensions** - one is enough!

## Summary

| Extension | Status | Action |
